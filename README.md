# HANGMAN_GAME
Welcome to the hangman game, it is focused on 5 of the most famous programming languages, good luck



for my programming class they sent us to make another simple game in python so I decided to recreate a funny game and simple one,something about programming you have to find out the programming  language letter by letter,the less you make mistakes, the higher your score will be.









1-First we import some modules assing a list for hangman states,words,spaces, assing some variables and declare the flag variable

2-Then we create while loop and we assign the instructions that will pass while the flag variable is "si"

3- if the player wins or loses he could play again and the word,hangman and spaces will be restored also when he wins we give him and score,score is the length of the word multiplied by the number of attempts left over to complete the word,the less you make a mistake, the higher your score will be.
